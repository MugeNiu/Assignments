	    <h1>What's AIIB and Why Doesn't the U.S. Want Its Allies to Join It?</h1>

	    	<h2>What is AIIB?</h2>
	    	<p> It's known by many as China's new World Bank for Asia. Basically China and 20 other Asian nations got together to create a multi-national bank to raise money to build things like roads, bridges and cell phone towers in Asia.</p>
	    	<h2>Interesting, but what is so controversial about that? You Ask.</h2>
	    	<p> Normally the word "infrastructure" and "diplomatic battle" don't belong in the same sentence, but this time the U.S. openly lobbied its friends not to join the AIIB. This is because the U.S. is concerned that China will use this new $50 bln bank to extend its power in Asia at the expense of America and Japan. An existing multi-national bank, called Asia Development Bank (ADB),is led by the U.S. and Japan for years. China is growing impatient of not getting enough say in ADB so it started its own club. 
	    	</p>
	    	<h2>So China started its own club, but surely U.S.'s closest friends won't join, right?</h2>
	    	<p> About that... The UK actually announced it will be a founding member of the AIIB soon after the White House made that statement. The two then exchanged some snarky comments publicly. Awkward. Some other U.S. allies also followed suite, like Australia, France and Germany.</p>
